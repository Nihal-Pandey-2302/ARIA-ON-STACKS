## üéØ The Problem & Our Solution

Tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWAs) is crippled by a fundamental bottleneck: **trust and liquidity**. Manual verification is slow and expensive, and even tokenized assets have no native venue to be traded.

**A.R.I.A. (Automated RWA Intelligence & Authentication)** solves this by creating a trustless, end-to-end ecosystem built on the Stacks blockchain. We have built a complete, self-sustaining protocol that handles the entire lifecycle of a Real-World Asset.

Our "document-to-DeFi" lifecycle is live and fully automated:

1. **AI-Powered Verification:** A custom AI Agent uses **Google Gemini** for deep data analysis and **QR Code Cross-Verification** to provide two-factor proof of authenticity.
2. **On-Chain Integrity:** The AI's full verification report is formatted into rich metadata and permanently pinned to **IPFS**.
3. **Permissioned Minting:** Our backend service, acting as the sole trusted minter, programmatically calls our **SIP-009 RWA NFT** contract to mint a "Verified RWA" NFT directly to the user's wallet.
4. **Trade & Earn:** The user can list their new NFT on our custom **Marketplace Contract**. When sold, the contract automatically routes a 5% platform fee to our **Staking Contract**.
5. **Community-Owned Yield:** Holders of the native **SIP-010 $ARIA** token can stake their tokens to earn a proportional share of all platform revenue in STX, creating a complete, decentralized economic loop.

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture on Stacks

Our architecture is a seamless integration of off-chain AI processing with on-chain, composable Clarity smart contracts. The Python backend acts as a trusted oracle, performing verification and executing the permissioned `mint-rwa` function on the RWA NFT contract. From that point on, all user interactions‚Äîlisting, purchasing, staking, and claiming rewards‚Äîare direct, trustless transactions with the Clarity contracts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

We delivered a feature-rich MVP that showcases a truly investable and self-sustaining protocol.

* ‚úÖ **Two-Sided Marketplace:** A fully on-chain venue for users to browse, buy, and sell verified RWA NFTs, completing the asset's liquidity lifecycle.
* ‚úÖ **Complete Economic Loop:** An end-to-end business model where marketplace fees are automatically routed to the staking contract to be distributed as real yield (STX) to $ARIA token stakers.
* ‚úÖ **Deep AI Integration:** Multi-factor verification using Gemini Vision and on-document QR code validation, presented in a polished "AI Report Card".
* ‚úÖ **Modern UX/UI:** A custom dark theme, a modern header, toast notifications, and integration with the **Leather Wallet** for a smooth user experience.
* ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Dashboards:** Includes a full-featured "Staking Dashboard" and the "Marketplace."
* ‚úÖ **Transparent Backend Interaction:** The frontend provides real-time polling and feedback as the backend mints the NFT, giving users a clear view into the on-chain confirmation process.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Live Demo (Recommended)

**Live Application URL:** **[YOUR_VERCEL_OR_NETLIFY_URL]**

**User Journey:**

1. Connect your **Leather Wallet** (set to Testnet).
2. Go to the **"Mint RWA"** page to upload a document. The backend will verify it and mint the NFT to your wallet.
3. Wait for the transaction to confirm. The UI will update automatically.
4. List your newly minted NFT on the marketplace.
5. Navigate to the **"Marketplace"** page to browse and buy assets.
6. Visit the **"Staking"** page to stake your `$ARIA` tokens and earn platform fees in STX.

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Nihal-Pandey-2302/ARIA-ON-STACKS.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Setup & Run Backend:**

    ```sh
    cd aria-backend
    
    # Setup Python environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Setup Node.js helper environment
    npm install
    
    # Create a .env file with your API keys and the contract owner's secret key
    # See .env.example
    
    # Run the Flask server
    python app.py
    ```

3. **Setup & Run Frontend:**

    ```sh
    cd ../aria-frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
